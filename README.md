# EasyFlux<sup>&reg;</sup> DL for CR3000

EasyFluxÂ® DL for CR3000 is a free CRBasic program that enables a CR3000
data logger to report fully corrected fluxes of CO<sub>2</sub>, latent heat
(H<sub>2</sub>O), sensible heat, and momentum from a [Campbell Scientific](https://www.campbellsci.com/)
open-path eddy-covariance (EC) system. For official program documentation and 
downloads, refer to the project website:

## What's Here

This repository contains a version of EddyFlux-DL customized to run on research
towers operated in partnership with the Laboratory for Atmospheric Research at
Washington State University. These towers focus on agricultural research sites
and belong to multiple networks and/or projects, including: 

* USDA ARS Long-Term Agroeconomic Research ([LTAR](https://ltarnetwork.org)) Network
* Landscapes in Transition Pacific Northwest (LIT-PNW) Project
* the [AmeriFlux](https://ameriflux.lbl.gov/) Network

Program modifications are intended to be backwards-compatible and accretive,
but not all changes satisfy these goals. To make identifying and merging changes 
introduced by the vendor easier, official vendor releases are also tracked here
in a separate and unrelated branch history. 


## Getting Started

### Required Equipment ###

* CR3000 datalogger ([CR3000](https://www.campbellsci.com/cr3000))

### Supported Optional Sensors

> ***N.B.*** *this version has known channel assignment conflicts which prevent
> certain optional sensors from being enabled, regardless of compatibility in
> prior versions. Refer to comments in the program file for complete details. In

### Quick Setup

1. Connect the datalogger to power and sensors as described in relevant manuals.
3. Update the unique calibration values in `src/constants.cr3` and upload to
   to the datalogger.
2. Modify the program file (`src/default.cr3`) as needed to:
    * enable or disable sensors 
    * update other constants, such as UTC offset
3. Upload the program file to the datalogger.
4. Update station variables, as necessary.
