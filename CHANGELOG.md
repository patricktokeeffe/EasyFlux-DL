## Unreleased (easyflux-1.2-update)

This version imports changesets from EasyFlux-DL_CR3OP version 1.1&rarr;1.2.
Significant realignment means users will need to modify current deployments to conform to updated input channel locations.

* Support for ambient T/RH probes (HMP155A, HSC23, HMP45C) is reverted such that users now specify a multiplier and offset instead of selecting sensor type.
* Support for rain gauges (TE525 series) is likewise reverted so users specify the multiplier instead of selecting sensor type.
* All whitespace conflicts were resolved in favor of EasyFlux-DL base code.
* **All sensor input locations were reverted to match EasyFlux-DL base code. This highly substantial change affects most sensors.**
  As a result of limited input locations, the 034B cup-and-vane anemometer and NR01 component radiometer are mutually exclusive by default (to use both, specify different input channels).
* All hard-coded numbers for computations are changed from integer to float.
* Subroutine `FootprintCharacteristics_KormannMeixner`:
  * Incorporates thermal stratification as a function of stability from eqns (11) and (32) in *Kormann and Meixner (2001)*.
  * Modifies fourth footprint integration segment to increase integration interval by factor of 2.5 (4&rarr;10 x aerodynamic height)
    and increase scale factor of aerodynamic height used to calculate max range by factor of 5 (200&rarr;1000).
  * Modifies fifth footprint integration segment to increase scale factor of aerodynamic height used to calculate max range by factor of 5 (200&rarr;1000)
    and to iterate up to a fixed number of times instead of estimating number of steps required.


## [ProgSig 40826] 2018-11-29

### Added

* New support for logging TriStar 45 PWM solar charge controller metrics. Adds
  16 columns before door sensor histogram in `Flux_Notes` table.

----

## [ProgSig 29249] 2018-07-03

### Fixed

* Issue with calling the soil profile probes according to deployment log. All
  TDR-31X and 5TM soil probe measurements are moved into a separate scan with
  1-minute interval, versus the original slow sequence scan with 5-sec interval.

### Added

* New data table `LTAR_Met_1Minute` has all columns in table `LTAR_Met` except
  for soil profile measurements

### Changed

* Data table `Flux`
    * all TDR-related column names are changed from `tdr315` &rarr;`tdr31X`
    * half as many columns for heat flux (non-profile) TDR probes 
* Data table `LTAR_Met`
    * Fourty new columns for e/e_sat, TDR soil profile and heat flux measurements

### Removed

* Reduce soil probes supporting heat flux plate measurements from 2 &rarr; 1.
* Thirteen columns prefixed "`old_`" are removed from the beginning of data 
  table `Flux`. The pre-EasyFlux computations are no longer performed, though
  time series table `Time_Series` still contains alternate CO2 density value.

----

## [ProgSig 28444] 2017-11-03

### Added

* Thirty new columns in data table `Flux` are inserted after `SHFP_1_SENS`
  containing measurements from six soil profile TDR sensors

----

## [ProgSig 36802] 2017-08-14

### Issues

* (Unconfirmed) check whether `RH_Avg` in new table only updates every half-hour

### Added

* New data table `LTAR_CORe` represents 15min meteorology data submission
  format for sites in the USDA Long-Term Agroecosystem Research (LTAR) program
    * Covers both Phase 1 & Phase 2 measurements
    * Anticipates other variables of interest

----

## [ProgSig 13636] 2017-06-20

### Issues

> Non-striken issues in past releases may still be relevant.

### Added

* Thirteen new columns in data table `Flux`, after column `cupvane_WD_csi_Std`,
  representing data from the soil heat flux plate and associated TDR-series soil
  probes

----

## [ProgSig 20626] 2017-06-02

### Fixed

* Unique calibration constants can now be edited in the field by changing the
  file `CPU:constants.cr3` and reloading the program. The include file can be
  edited locally on the datalogger keypad, or remotely via support software.

### Added

* Enable field editing of calibration sensitivity values for net radiometer
  (NR-Lite2), quantum sensor (LI-190SB), and soil heat flux plate (HFP01).
* New columns in data table `Flux`:
    * after `Rn_meas`, new column `NRLITE_SENS` is unique sensor calibration
      for net radiometer
    * after `PAR_density`, new column `QUANTUM_SENS` is unique sensor calibration
      for quantum PAR sensor

----

## [ProgSig 65148] 2017-05-12

### Fixed

* Retrieve alternate CO<sub>2</sub> density value from `EC100()` instruction 
  which is required to complete secondary CO<sub>2</sub> flux calculations.
* Correct errors in calculation of friction velocity (`old_u_star`) and Obukhov
  length (`old_L`) 

### Changed

* Declare GPS receiver variables *Public* so they can be viewed in real-time.
* Data table: **Flux**
    * Table now includes columns previously saved in *Flux_Notes* data table.
* Data table: **Flux_Notes**
    * Table is now merged into *Flux* data table.

----

## [ProgSig 45290] 2017-05-12

This revision is based on *EasyFlux DL for CR3000 v.1.1* by Campbell Scientific.

* Data logger operating system `CR3000.Std.31` or newer is required.
* If using a model EC150 (not IRGASON), then EC100 OS version 7.01 or later is
  required.

### Issues

* ~~Secondary CO<sub>2</sub> flux calculations are incomplete due to missing
  alternate CO<sub>2</sub> density value (wrong command sent to `EC100()`
  instruction), and intermediate array being under sized.~~
* Column `old_CO2_hf_mg_m3_Avg` is missing units in table *Flux*.
* Changes to wiring locations prevent certain inactive sensors from being used.
* Comments on GPS receiver integration incorrectly refer to ports C7/C8 instead
  of ports C3/C4.
* UTC offset used by `GPS()` instruction is a hard-coded constant.
* Value of "0" used for `MaxTimeDiff` parameter in `GPS()` instruction may
  cause skipped scans in older hardware/firmware.
* ~~Unique calibration constants cannot be edited via *ConstTable* because 
  program is too large to edit in datalogger memory.~~

### Fixed

* Correct spelling of "Kelvin" for public variable `T_nr` (radiometer body
  temperature). Does not affect data tables since variable is not in use.

### Added

* Re-introduce the pre-EasyFlux calculation of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)
  flux based on standard reported CO<sub>2</sub> mass density (labeled `old_Fc_wpl`)
  and add second, parallel flux calculation (labeled `old_Fc_hf_wpl`) using 
  CO<sub>2</sub> density derived using high-frequency sonic temperature instead
  of slow-response thermistor. This feature is expected to be removed and is 
  already deprecated. **Requires EC150 gas analyzer operating with EC100 control 
  unit having firmware version 7.01 or later.** References:

      anemometer "sonic temperature" value instead of slow-response thermistor 
      ambient temperature.
* Data table: **Flux**
    * Thirteen new columns are inserted at front of table which contain results
      from the simplified (pre-EasyFlux) eddy-covariance computational model
      using CO<sub>2</sub> density calculated using both high-frequency (`CO2_hf`)
      and slow-response (`CO2`) ambient temperature values: `old_L`, `old_u_star`,
      `old_Fc_wpl`, `old_Fc_hf_wpl`, `old_LE_wpl`, `old_Hc`, `old_Uz_Std`,
      `old_CO2_mg_m3_Avg`, `old_CO2_mg_m3_Std`, `old_CO2_hf_mg_m3_Avg`,
      `old_CO2_hf_mg_m3_Std`, `old_Tc_Avg`, `old_amb_press_Avg`
    * Four new columns inserted after `PAR_density_Avg` contain data from MetOne
      cup-and-vane anemometer (model 034-B): `cupvane_WS_Avg`, `cupvane_WS_rslt_Avg`,
      `cupvane_WD_rslt_Avg`, `cupvane_WD_csi_Std`
* Data table: **Flux_Notes**
    * New column `door_is_open_Hst` inserted after `Lv` contains time-weighted
      average of enclosure door status where non-zero values indicate door was
      open for a duration of the sampling interval.
